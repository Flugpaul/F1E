# F1E
After the German championship 2021 with successful flights with new lightweight wings (build by Bolgov) I decided to renew my model strategy for F1E based on this experience. 
One main part of my thought was: which steering device I should use? All off my and Danielaâ€™s models use multiple versions of steering and in also different professional conditions. My view about the fence to successful pilots let me understand, that for the design of my models a renew of the wing load should be one of the priorities. 
After some research I decided to build up my own steering. The specifications were: 

â€¢	The magnetic field and the heading should be detected with an electronic sensor.

â€¢	The evaluation of the course deviation should be processed by a microprocessor (Arduino)

â€¢	The whole steering device should be exchangeable with the traditional magnet	steering

â€¢	The steering should work standalone without the direct dependency from an electronical timer

â€¢	The steering should be prepared for an interface to an electronical timer

â€¢	The usage of the steering should be reduced only to one function, which define the flight direction and the trimming for flying straight ahead.

Due to my status of early retirement in May 2021, end of the main paragliding season, and the Corona circumstances I used the late autumn time and beginning winter2021/2022 for the own electronical design. Now the first prototype is ready, and I am very satisfied about the result. 
One of the most challenging issues was the choice of an appropriate magnetic sensor. I had a lot of unsuccessful attempts, but at least I found a very good alternate, which could calculate the needed heading without interferences from pitch and roll movements. 
The research was very time-consuming, so I decided to make all details like the coding and the circuit diagram pubic via the github repository. As a former manager for knowledge management in a worldwide company I know that sharing knowledge is useful for the progress of development.  With starting the first flight evaluations I will complete the content. 

Feel free to use, comment, add, discuss what I have designed. I would be happy about the feedback from the freeflight/F1E community. ðŸ˜Š
